## About This Repository

This repository represents my **hands-on learning journey in Computer Vision** as part of my coursework and self-practice at **AIDTM**.

All projects in this repository were built during classroom labs, assignments, and personal experimentation to strengthen my practical understanding of computer vision concepts.

Rather than focusing on theory only, I emphasized:
- Real implementation  
- Understanding algorithms visually  
- Writing clean and reusable code  
- Experimenting with real images and videos

## What I Learned

Through these projects, I gained practical experience in:

### Core Concepts
- Image preprocessing (grayscale, blur, thresholding)
- Feature detection and matching
- Object detection and tracking
- Face and eye detection
- Semantic segmentation
- CNN-based classification

### Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- YOLOv8  
- UNet

## Learning Approach at AIDTM

The learning methodology at **AIDTM** focuses on:

- Problem-based learning  
- Industry-oriented projects  
- Research mindset  
- Building systems, not just models  

Each folder in this repository reflects a **specific lab or module** covered during the Computer Vision curriculum.
