# Image Classification Projects using CNN & Transfer Learning

This repository contains two deep learning projects focused on **image classification** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and **Transfer Learning** with VGG16. Both projects are implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.

These projects demonstrate practical skills in:
- Data preprocessing
- Model building
- Training & evaluation
- Performance improvement using deep learning techniques
